# Qadru_Bot
My attempt to make a fully open source quadruped robot as affordable as possible 

I might move to the Repo by InotspotI and build from there. The maintainer has designed the robot pretty well and I think, I can leverage that and build a open source robot for everyone to understand.

This repository just has the visual and collision parameters of the robot(The robot description is the only thing that has been updated here)

Feel free to reach out, and keep an eye on my github, newer projects are coming.
